# 🏗️ Refactoring Guide: AI Impact Dashboard

This guide explains how to split the monolithic `app.py` file into 4 distinct modules. The goal is to separate the visual configuration, data processing logic, chart generation, and the User Interface (UI) following the **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** principle.

## Directory Structure
Once finished, your project folder will look like this:
```text
/project_folder
 ├── config.py      # Colors, themes, and base layout
 ├── data.py        # Data ingestion, cleaning, and KPI calculations
 ├── figures.py     # Plotly chart generation
 ├── app.py         # Dash initialization and UI layout
 ├── final_dataset.xlsx
 ├── Survey_AI.csv
 └── students_ai_usage.csv
